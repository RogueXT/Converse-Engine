The communication system between the ECU and sub controllers which control valves and other 
peripherals is done using a simple coded system which implements a string of characters indicating 
peripheral type, number and task.
This is called the "Working ID". The "Working ID" consists of two sections. The base ID and the 
control assignment.

Each subcontroller carries a unique base ID related to the system.
Below are examples of base IDs

Controller 1 ID = "SBC01"
Controller 2 ID = "SBC02"

The base ID's consist of two parts. The "SBC" tag and the number preceeding it.
The SBC is used to indicate the ECU that it is a sub controller and the 
numbers preceeding it indicate the unique number corresponding to the controller.

The second section of each Working ID is the control assignment. The control assignment is a number
appended to the base ID which corresponds to a certain action. The actions vary depending on the 
peripheral type.

Below is a list denoting peripheral action to control assignment number.

Valve |OPEN| - "1"
Valve |CLOSE| - "0"
Measuring device |Reading| = "2" 
Transmission |Data| = "3"

Principle of operation

ECU
- System request for communication with a controller
- Retrieval of base ID of destination controller 
- Appending of control assignment to base ID to create "Working ID"
- Sending of Working ID to destination controller

Sub Controller
- Sub Controller receives Working ID
- Sub Controller parses Working ID
- Sub Controller verifies base ID
- Sub Controller executes control assignment





Sending Data request
- encode -> receiving controller ID, data
- checksum
- shortest path calculation 
- data transmission process (specialized request module-on demand)

Recieving Data from request
- checksum
- decode
- data sent to PTAM
- data sent to calling process

Recieving Data - General (GSE, tank controllers)
- interrupt
- checksum
- decode
- data sent to PTAM
- hold until General receiving data process parses Information 

Data Passthrough
- interrupt
- data sent to transmission queue
- hold until data transmission process (general process-batch)
